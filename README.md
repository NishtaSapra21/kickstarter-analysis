### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launched Date

Considering below dataset for all categories based on "Launch Date", we can observe that successful outcomes are average 50%, failed outcomes are 38% and canceled outcomes are average 10% of total outcomes thru out the year. Almost same number of campaigns are launches thru out the years for each month. This data represents very steady observations.
